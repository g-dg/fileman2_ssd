		<h1>Upgrade from 1.x to 2.0</h1>
		<p>
			Be sure to fill in the database details in the configuration file "<code>_setup/upgrade_scripts/1_x-2_0/config.php</code>".
		</p>
		<p>
			The old database must use a schema compatible with the 1.x series,
			and the new database must be an empty (ie. 0 bytes), readable and writable file.
		</p>
		<p>
			The new database file is taken from the new config file.
			Make sure you set up the main config file "<code>_config.php</code>" properly.
		</p>
		<p>
			The paths in the configuration file are relative to the root of the application.
		</p>
		<p>
			If, for some reason, the upgrade cannot be done, you will be redirected back to this page.
		</p>
		<p>Click <a href="upgrade.php">here</a> to upgrade</p>
